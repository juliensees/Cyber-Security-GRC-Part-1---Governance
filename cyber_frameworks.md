### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

- cyber risk management framework 
  - provides a standard approach to review strategic and operational activities and to facilitate a common understanding of the cyber risk management processes.   
  - Objective: - Define the process for the assessment and treatment of risks and define the acceptable level of risk.  
               - Apply risk management practices to enhance strategic, tactical, and operational decision making.  
    * The result from a framework are "controls"  
  - Controls: Apply risk management practices to enhance strategic, tactical, and operational decision making.  
              - They can be physical, administrative, or technical, and they are implemented to mitigate or eliminate risks to information security.  
      - ex. passwords, mFA, firewalls, IDS (intrusion detection system), IPS (intrusion prevention systems), encryption, backup systems, policies & procedures
   
  - In general, companies and organisations have a legal duty to protect the personal information they collect from their customers, employees, and others. If   they fail to adequately protect this information and a breach occurs, they may be held liable for any resulting damages.  
            - usually the governmental regulators will fine companies, rarely do individuals get payouts... usually just credit monitoring at best

  - cybersecurity measures and protocols (in order to mitigate legal liability)  
    - These measures may include regular security audits, employee training programs, and the use of strong passwords and encryption technologies.
   
    - Many organisations implement frameworks to establish a common language among themselves and their clients. For example, frameworks allow you to align   conversations with customers on what they want ‘good’ to look like.
   
  ### Framework Benefits
  - Risk management: Cybersecurity frameworks provide a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks. By identifying and assessing risks, organisations can   prioritise their cybersecurity efforts and allocate resources more effectively.    
  - Compliance: Many organisations are subject to regulatory requirements and industry standards related to cybersecurity. Cybersecurity frameworks can help   organisations comply with these requirements and avoid legal and financial penalties for non-compliance.  
  - Consistency: Cybersecurity frameworks provide a consistent approach to managing cybersecurity risks across an organisation. This ensures that all departments   and employees are working towards the same goal and following the same procedures.  
  - Proactive: Cybersecurity frameworks promote a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By focusing on preventing cybersecurity incidents before they occur,   organisations can reduce the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity breach.
  - Continuous improvement: Cybersecurity frameworks encourage organisations to continually review and update their cybersecurity policies and procedures to stay   ahead of emerging threats and technology. This helps organisations adapt to new risks and technologies and maintain their cybersecurity posture over time.
  - Cost-Effective: Cybersecurity frameworks can help organisations allocate resources more effectively by prioritising their cybersecurity efforts based on risk.   This can reduce the overall cost of cybersecurity while still providing adequate protection for sensitive information.
